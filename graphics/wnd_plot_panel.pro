; NAME: 
; WND_PLOT_PANEL
;
; PURPOSE: 
; The procedure plots a panel of Wind solar wind data. It simply calls WND_MAG_PLOT_PANEL or WND_SWE_PLOT_PANEL, depending on the parameter.
; 
; CATEGORY: 
; Graphics
; 
; CALLING SEQUENCE:  
; WND_PLOT_PANEL
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
; Xmaps: The total number of columns of plots on the resulting page.
; Default is 1.
;
; Ymaps: The total number of rows of plots on the resulting page.
; Default is 1.
;
; Xmap: The current horizontal (column) index of this panel.
; Default is 0.
;
; Ymap: The current vertical (row) index of this panel.
; Default is 0.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
; DATE: A scalar or 2-element vector giving the time range to plot, 
; in YYYYMMDD or MMMYYYY format.
;
; TIME: A 2-element vector giving the time range to plot, in HHII format.
;
; LONG: Set this keyword to indicate that the TIME value is in HHIISS
; format rather than HHII format.
;
; PARAM: Set this keyword to specify the parameter to plot. Allowable
; values are 'bx_gse','by_gse','bz_gse','by_gsm','bz_gsm','bt',
; 'vx_gse','vy_gse','vz_gse','vt','np' and 'pd'.
;
; BAR: Set this keyword to allow for space right of the panel for a colorbar.
;
; YRANGE: Set this keyword to change the range of the y axis.
;
; SILENT: Set this keyword to surpress all messages/warnings.
;
; CHARTHICK: Set this keyword to change the font thickness.
;
; CHARSIZE: Set this keyword to change the font size. 
;
; PSYM: Set this keyword to change the symbol used for plotting.
;
; XSTYLE: Set this keyword to change the style of the x axis.
;
; YSTYLE: Set this keyword to change the style of the y axis.
;
; XTITLE: Set this keyword to change the title of the x axis.
;
; YTITLE: Set this keyword to change the title of the y axis.
;
; XTICKS: Set this keyword to change the number of major x tick marks.
;
; XMINOR: Set this keyword to change the number of minor x tick marks.
;
; YTICKS: Set this keyword to change the number of major y tick marks.
;
; YMINOR: Set this keyword to change the number of minor y tick marks.
;
; LINESTYLE: Set this keyword to change the style of the line.
; Default is 0 (solid).
;
; LINECOLOR: Set this keyword to a color index to change the color of the line.
; Default is black.
;
; LINETHICK: Set this keyword to change the thickness of the line.
; Default is 1.
;
; XTICKFORMAT: Set this keyword to change the formatting of the time fopr the x axis.
;
; YTICKFORMAT: Set this keyword to change the formatting of the y axis values.
;
; POSITION: Set this keyword to a 4-element vector of normalized coordinates 
; if you want to override the internal
; positioning calculations.
;
; FIRST: Set this keyword to indicate that this panel is the first panel in
; a ROW of plots. That will force Y axis labels.
;
; LAST: Set this keyword to indicate that this is the last panel in a column,
; hence XTITLE and XTICKNAMES will be set.
;
; WITH_INFO: Set this keyword to leave some extra space on the top for plotting noise
; and frequency info panels.
;
; INFO: Set this keyword to plot the panel above a panel which position has been
; defined using DEFINE_PANEL(XMAPS, YMAP, XMAP, YMAP, /WITH_INFO).
